//! The collapsed Metrics section of the dashboard: every counter in
//! `metrics.rs`, split into titled subsections with the alert/warn policy
//! applied per row.
//!
//! Two rules keep this readable, because a flat list of ~150 counters (of
//! which nearly all read zero on a healthy daemon) buries the handful that
//! are moving:
//!
//! - one number per cell. A label that has to enumerate its value's
//!   positions (`(current / max, peak, sent, full-waits, ...)`) is a legend,
//!   and a legend means the cell is really several cells. Genuine ratios
//!   (`hits / misses`, `requests -> served`) stay together, because there the
//!   pairing is the metric.
//! - every counter belongs to exactly one [`Groups::group`]. Adding a
//!   counter means choosing its subsection.
