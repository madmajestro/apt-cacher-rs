//! Splice-based upstream proxy for the sendfile backend: connects to the
//! mirror (HTTP or HTTPS), moves the response body to the client socket via
//! tee+splice fan-out while caching it to disk, and commits the download
//! through `RenameBarrier` -- the `Download -> Verifying` flip on the
//! connection task ([`commit::Committable`]), everything with I/O in it on a
//! task of its own ([`commit::CommitTail`]), so the connection returns to its
//! request loop with the client's last body byte rather than behind an
//! `fsync`, a hash and three DB writes.
//!
//! This file owns the entry point the sendfile backend calls
//! ([`splice_proxy`]) and the types it matches on ([`SpliceProxyOutcome`],
//! [`SpliceProxyError`]), the
//! request drive ([`splice_proxy_drive`] and its phase functions) and the
//! per-request state structs ([`ClientConn`], [`CacheTarget`],
//! [`RateTimestamps`]). The mechanics live in submodules:
//!
//! - [`upstream`]: the `UpstreamConn` enum, the idle pool and `ResponseBody`,
//!   TCP/TLS connect and connect-error classification.
//! - [`http`]: request formatting, response-head parsing into
//!   `UpstreamResponse`, the `BodyFraming` relays and the chunked decoder.
//! - [`acquire`]: standard connect with retry/backoff, redirect and
//!   partial-discard reconnects, each yielding an `UpstreamExchange`.
//! - [`body`]: the zero-copy and userspace-TLS body loops on `BodyTransfer`,
//!   client demotion to file serving, pipe helpers.
//! - [`detached`]: the client-less download the parallel-download hack's
//!   nudge leaves running after the 429 went out.
//! - [`volatile`]: the buffered download path for volatile responses without
//!   `Content-Length`.
//! - `cleanup_bridge` (hyper-less builds): cleanup's index fetch entry.
//! - [`simple_proxy`]: the cache-less pass-through relay.
