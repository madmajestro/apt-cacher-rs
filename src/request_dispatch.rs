//! Unified request pre-flight and URI dispatch entry point shared by the
//! hyper backend in `hyper_conn.rs` and the sendfile backend in
//! `sendfile_conn.rs`.
//!
//! The pre-flight ([`preflight_method`] + [`preflight_target`]) is the
//! backend-independent part of "is this a request we serve at all": method
//! gate, proxy-client ACL for `CONNECT`, URI scheme and target-form gates,
//! the HTTP/1.1 `Host` requirement, the web-interface ACL and `Host` name
//! gate, and the port sanity check.  Both functions are pure over their
//! parameters (no `global_config()`); the backends feed them the
//! already-parsed request line and map the shared [`RejectReason`] onto their
//! response type.  The host allowlist stays in
//! `permitted_host_cache::authorize_cache_access`, which the backends call on
//! the returned [`RequestTarget::Proxy`] host.
//!
//! Owns the request-classification pipeline that previously appeared inline
//! in both dispatchers:
//!
//!   1. diff-request gate          - reject (410) pdiff URLs when configured,
//!      else fall through silently as `Unrecognized`
//!   2. [`normalize_uri_path`]     - collapse `//` runs / strip `.` segments
//!   3. [`parse_request_path`]     - structural shape-match into `ResourceFile`
//!   4. [`classify_request`]       - per-field URL-decode + allowlist validate
//!   5. unsafe-cache-path gate     - empty/dot segments, control bytes once
//!      decoded, on a classified request
//!   6. flat-blocklist collision   - host-level `flat/` claimed by structured
//!   7. deferred `Origin` DB write - for `Packages` requests w/ a real arch
//!   8. unsafe-proxy-path gate     - traversal/control bytes in passthrough
//!
//! Backends translate the returned [`DispatchOutcome`] into their response
//! type.  All logging, metric bumping, the deferred `Origin` DB write and
//! `record_uncacheable` happen here, so the two parallel paths cannot drift
//! apart.  [`dispatch_request`] runs exactly once per client request: the
//! sendfile backend's `NotApplicable` handoff carries its outcome to hyper
//! (`hyper_conn::HandoffPlan`) instead of letting hyper re-dispatch, so every
//! side-effect in here is exactly-once by construction.
//!
