//! Disk-quota accounting for the cache directory.
//!
//! Every size is counted as [`accounted_size`]: the length rounded up to
//! whole [`QUOTA_BLOCK_SIZE`] (4 KiB) blocks, 0 for an empty file. Counting
//! apparent lengths let millions of tiny index and by-hash files occupy far
//! more disk than the quota saw. The rounding applies to every input -- a
//! reservation's `Content-Length`, the replaced file, an adopted, kept or
//! removed partial, the finalised size -- and to every file the cache scan
//! and cleanup count, so the reconcile compares like with like; all figures
//! below are in these units.
//!
//! One mutex guards every number the quota decision depends on, so a check,
//! its reservation, a finalisation and the cleanup reconcile can never
//! interleave inconsistently:
//!
//! - `size`: the accounted cache size. Files below the mirror directories --
//!   the `.partial` files in their `tmp/` subdirectories included -- plus the
//!   reservation of every download in flight. Kept partials are disk usage a
//!   failing upstream can grow at will (a partial survives its download for a
//!   later resume), so they count like cached files: a reservation that
//!   resumes a partial *adopts* its bytes (they move from the kept partial
//!   into the reservation), a download that ends without a commit hands back
//!   what its partial then holds (only the unwritten remainder is reverted),
//!   and every removal of a partial releases its bytes exactly once --
//!   cleanup's `tmp/` reap through the reconcile's `removed`, every other
//!   unlink (a discarded resume, a checksum mismatch, a replaced leftover)
//!   through [`CacheQuota::release_removed_partial`]. A download claims its
//!   partial's path before touching it and holds the claim until both its
//!   partial guard and its [`ReservedPartial`] are gone; cleanup reaps only
//!   unclaimed partials (`partial_claim`), so a partial is released by the
//!   reap or by the reservation that adopted it, never by both. The random
//!   scratch files of volatile downloads live in the cache root's `tmp/`,
//!   are unlinked with their download and purged at startup, and are never
//!   counted.
//! - `inflight_reserved` / `inflight_replaced`: what the live reservations
//!   added to and subtracted from `size` (`replaced` includes the adopted
//!   partials). The reconcile adds their net to the scanned on-disk total
//!   instead of asking the active-downloads registry, so the comparison is
//!   taken under the same lock as `size`.
//! - `inflight_unwritten`: the bytes the live reservations writing a partial
//!   may still add to it (`reserved - adopted`). The scan counts such a
//!   partial at whatever size it had when walked, anywhere between adopted
//!   and complete, so the reconcile's lower bound is widened by this much.
//! - `committed_grown` / `committed_shrunk`: monotonic on-disk deltas the
//!   scan may have seen on either side of: finished commits (renames; a
//!   partial's rename out of `tmp/` can be counted in both places), partials
//!   kept by an unfinished download, and partial removals. A reconcile
//!   snapshots them before its scan and treats the changes that landed
//!   during the scan as unknown-to-the-scan: the accounted size is only
//!   "repaired" when it lies outside the interval those changes could
//!   explain. Without that, a download committed after the scan had walked
//!   its directory was repaired away, under-counting the cache until the
//!   next cleanup.
//!
//! A [`QuotaReservation`] is minted only by [`CacheQuota::try_acquire`] /
//! [`CacheQuota::acquire_for_cleanup`], is required to build a download
//! barrier (`guards.rs`), is finalised inside the rename step
//! (`integrity::verify_and_rename`, in the same blocking closure as the
//! `rename(2)`, so a cancelled commit future cannot land the file and revert
//! the reservation), and reverts itself on drop -- keeping the bytes its
//! [`ReservedPartial`] then holds.
//!
//! The same admission also keeps `min_disk_free` free on the cache
//! filesystem ([`DiskHeadroom`], with or without a `disk_quota`): the quota
//! bounds what this daemon accounts, but the filesystem is what runs out,
//! and it may be shared or already fuller than the cache. The decision reads
//! a `statvfs(3)` sample at most [`DISK_SAMPLE_TTL`] old (older only while
//! the one outstanding probe hangs, see
//! [`CacheQuota::refresh_disk_headroom`]), minus the full
//! [`disk_needed`] of every reservation still live (`inflight_disk`) or
//! ended since the sample was taken (`retired_disk`): a download from a slow
//! mirror writes for minutes, so a sample taken while it runs shows only
//! what it wrote so far, and one charged only until the next sample would
//! let each later miss pass on a figure that ignores it. The bytes a live
//! download already wrote are charged twice -- once by the lowered sample,
//! once by its full reservation -- which errs on the safe side of a floor;
//! tracking the written remainder would mean a counter on every backend's
//! write path. Cleanup's index fetches are admitted past this floor for the
//! reason they are admitted past the quota, and count against it like any
//! other reservation.
