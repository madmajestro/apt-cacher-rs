//! Download-commit integrity verification.
//!
//! Before a finished download is renamed into the cache, verify its content
//! against the repository's own metadata: by-hash files self-verify (digest
//! in the URL); `.deb` (Pool) and `Packages` files are checked against an
//! in-memory registry populated from streamed `Release` / `Packages` ingest.
//! Coupled into `guards::RenameBarrier::commit` so no download backend can
//! skip it.
//!
//! Defence in depth only -- APT's client-side GPG check remains the
//! cryptographic root of trust.
//!
//! Scope: verification gates *caching*, not in-flight *delivery*. A client
//! served concurrently from the same download -- a late joiner streaming the
//! growing partial file, or one attaching during the post-download `Verifying`
//! hash window (`ActiveDownloadStatus::Verifying`) -- receives its bytes before
//! the digest is known. A mismatch then blocks the `rename` (nothing enters the
//! cache) but cannot unsend what was already streamed; such readers hold an open
//! FD and finish serving even after the temp file is unlinked. That is
//! acceptable precisely because this is defence in depth: the concurrent
//! client's own APT GPG check is the backstop. So a reader path serving an
//! unverified `Verifying`/`Download` file is by design, not a bug to "fix".
//!
//! The registry learns an index's digests when the index is committed, and
//! again whenever a request for it is answered without a commit (a cache
//! hit, a client or upstream 304) while its digests are missing: after a
//! restart, an eviction from its scope, or a skipped or transiently failed
//! ingest. `ingest_ledger` records which cache files are ingested (or failed
//! for good), so a warm index costs `schedule_ingest` classifying the file
//! and reading its registry scope's eviction epoch under the registry mutex,
//! then one `ingest_ledger` map lookup that finds it already marked and
//! returns; every backend calls [`note_cached_index_touch`] where it answers
//! an index from cache.
