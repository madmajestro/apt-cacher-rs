//! Source-preserving failures shared by transfer backends.
//!
//! Conversion from an untyped library error belongs at the operation adapter.
//! In particular, client failures cannot convert into a shared download failure.
//!
//! A failure that ends a delivery or a download is *concluded* exactly once, by
//! the owner that ends it: [`EndsDelivery::conclude`] (for a
//! [`DeliveryFailure`] or a `HeaderWriteFailure`),
//! [`DownloadFailure::conclude`] and `UpstreamError::conclude` bump the cause's terminal counters, log it
//! and return the [`Reported`] proof. Terminal counting is private to this
//! module, so no sink can count without logging, or count twice by forgetting
//! that another sink already did; constructing a failure has no side effects.
