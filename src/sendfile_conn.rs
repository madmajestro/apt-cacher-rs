//! Zero-copy client backend: parses requests with httparse, serves cached
//! files via sendfile(2), fetches misses through `splice` (with
//! `splice`) and hands everything else to hyper.
//!
//! Handoff contract: `ZeroCopyResult::NotApplicable` gives the current
//! request to hyper.  The work already done for it travels alongside as
//! `hyper_conn::HandoffPlan`, so hyper resumes the pipeline
//! (`serve_cache_miss`, `serve_downloading_file` or the simple proxy) instead
//! of re-parsing, re-dispatching and re-looking up.  A bodiless HTTP/1.1
//! keep-alive request is handed over alone: hyper reads only its head
//! (`MaybePrependedStream::single_request`), and the connection, with any
//! pipelined requests held back behind it, returns to this loop
//! (`hyper_conn::serve_handoff_request`).  Any other request takes the
//! connection with it: the buffered bytes are prepended to hyper's stream
//! and hyper serves every later request.  Every `NotApplicable` site builds
//! the plan variant matching what it has already run and accounted for; the
//! accounting rules are on `HandoffPlan` and `cache_layout::CacheMiss`.
