//! The barrier chain every download is registered, driven and finished
//! through, shared by all backends.
//!
//! One barrier at a time owns a download's `active_downloads` entry, and each
//! step consumes its predecessor, so an entry is ended exactly once:
//!
//! - [`InitBarrier`] (registered, nothing fetched) ends at one sink:
//!   [`InitBarrier::finished`] (the file on disk stays valid),
//!   [`InitBarrier::decline`] (answered without downloading; joiners answer
//!   what the originator answered) or [`InitBarrier::download`] (takes the
//!   `QuotaReservation` by value). One merely dropped publishes `Cancelled`,
//!   which joiners report as a failure of unknown cause -- so hyper's
//!   single-worker setup (`InitBarrier::run_settled`) must return the
//!   [`Settled`] proof of a sink, and splice's `InitBarrier::run` publishes
//!   a failing worker's concluded cause itself.
//! - [`DownloadBarrier`] (bytes flowing, readers ping-woken): its runner
//!   [`DownloadBarrier::run`] turns a failure into a [`FailedDownload`], which
//!   can be salvaged (skipped when the cache write is what failed) but never
//!   run again or renamed, and whose drop publishes the concluded cause.
//! - [`DownloadBarrier::begin_rename`] drops the `max_upstream_downloads`
//!   slot (`active_downloads::UpstreamSlot`, which [`InitBarrier::new`] took
//!   with the whole `Origination`) and the watch sender. Every backend
//!   reaches it, and nothing else releases a slot.
//! - [`RenameBarrier::commit`] is the only way a download finishes and the
//!   only constructor of an `integrity::RenamePlan`, so a new plan field is a
//!   compile error there and nowhere else. It also arms or clears
//!   `verify_throttle`.
//!
//! No backend commits on its connection task -- hyper spawns
//! `download_file`, splice spawns `splice/commit.rs::CommitTail`, and
//! `splice/detached.rs` is already off-connection -- so a completed response
//! never proves the cache file exists. That includes `splice/volatile.rs`:
//! it lands its buffered body in the temp file before the response, but
//! spawns the tail (`CommitTail::spawn_before_serving`) and serves from
//! memory while it commits.
