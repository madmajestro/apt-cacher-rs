//! Shared CONNECT-tunnel target validation and relay used by every HTTP
//! backend.
//!
//! Both the hyper and sendfile/splice backends call
//! [`validate_connect_target`] so their tunnel policy (enable flag, authority
//! bound, port ACL, mirror ACL) — and the metrics/log side effects — stay
//! identical. The per-request proxy-client ACL is *not* handled here; both
//! backends enforce `allowed_proxy_clients` for `CONNECT` in
//! `request_dispatch::preflight_method` before reaching this validator.
//!
//! The mirror ACL is fail-closed like `allowed_mirrors`: an empty
//! `https_tunnel_allowed_mirrors` permits no target.  A CONNECT relay is an
//! open TCP forwarder to any host on the permitted ports, so "no list" must
//! not mean "every host".  The *port* ACL is the deliberate opposite: an
//! empty `https_tunnel_allowed_ports` skips the port check entirely, because
//! the host list has already bounded the reachable targets by then.
//!
//! Established tunnels relay through [`copy_bidirectional_idle`], which
//! tears the tunnel down after `client_idle_timeout` without a byte in either
//! direction — otherwise a parked CONNECT socket pins two fds and an upstream
//! connection for as long as the peer likes.
