//! Coordinated state for in-flight downloads.
//!
//! [`ActiveDownloads`] is the single source of truth for "is a download for
//! this (mirror, debname) currently in flight?", shared between the hyper,
//! splice, and sendfile delivery backends. It is also the single enforcement
//! site for `max_upstream_downloads`: a new origination at the cap returns
//! `AtCapacity` from `ActiveDownloads::insert` /
//! `ActiveDownloads::originate` (late joiners are exempt — they open no new
//! upstream connection), which every backend maps to the canonical 503. It
//! also drives the related metric accounting so callers don't have to:
//!
//! - Late-joiner counts ([`metrics::LATE_JOINERS_TOTAL`] /
//!   [`metrics::LATE_JOINER_PEAK_PER_DOWNLOAD`]) — bumped atomically when
//!   `ActiveDownloads::insert` joins, `ActiveDownloads::attach` hits, or
//!   `ActiveDownloads::originate` returns `Concurrent`.
//! - Saturation transitions for `max_upstream_downloads`
//!   ([`metrics::UPSTREAM_DOWNLOAD_CAP_TRANSITIONS`]) — debounced via the
//!   module-private [`AT_CAP`] latch so each saturation episode counts once.
//! - Cap rejections ([`metrics::UPSTREAM_DOWNLOAD_REJECTED_CAP`]) — bumped
//!   for every refused origination.
//!
//! The cap counts [`UpstreamSlot`]s, not entries. A slot is minted with the
//! origination and released by dropping it, so the count is exactly the
//! number of alive tokens: no derived subtraction, no flag to remember to
//! set. An entry outlives its slot on purpose -- it stays mapped through
//! verification and rename so a joiner arriving in that window finds it
//! rather than missing both the entry and the cache file -- which is why
//! [`ActiveDownloads::len`] (the shutdown summary, the dashboard: "what
//! would be dropped now") and [`ActiveDownloads::upstream_slots`] (the cap,
//! the parallel-hack probability) are two different numbers.
