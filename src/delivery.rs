//! Completion bookkeeping for bodies served from the cache to a client.
//!
//! Every path that ships a cached (or in-progress) file - hyper stream,
//! channel, sendfile - ends the same way: bump `SERVED_<mechanism>` +
//! `SERVED_TOTAL` iff the body was fully delivered, log one completion or
//! abort line whose wording only differs in the mechanism token and the
//! cached/late-joiner phrasing, and record a `deliveries` row on success.
//! [`finish_cached_serve`] is the single implementation; the hyper bodies
//! call it from `Drop` (see `accounted_body.rs`), sendfile after its
//! syscall loop. (The splice path logs a combined upstream+client line and
//! stays separate.)
